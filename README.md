# Inventory Management System Readme

## Overview

This Inventory Management System is implemented using Java Spring MVC, Hibernate, ORM, and JPA for the backend, while the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, JSP, and JavaScript for validations. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on inventory data, and any changes made are reflected in the underlying SQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Java Spring MVC: A robust framework for building enterprise-level Java applications.
  - Hibernate: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for simplifying database interactions.
  - JPA (Java Persistence API): A specification for managing relational data in Java applications.

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML: Markup language for structuring web content.
  - CSS: Stylesheet language for designing the appearance of the application.
  - JSP (JavaServer Pages): A technology for developing web pages that support dynamic content.
  - JavaScript: Programming language for client-side scripting and validations.

- **Database:**
  - SQL: Standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases.

## Functionality

The Inventory Management System offers the following functionalities:

1. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete inventory data through a user-friendly interface.

2. **Database Interaction:**
   - Hibernate and JPA ensure seamless communication between the application and the SQL database, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval.

3. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Any changes made to the inventory data are immediately reflected in the database, ensuring real-time synchronization.

4. **Frontend Population:**
   - The frontend is dynamically populated with inventory products retrieved from the backend database.
